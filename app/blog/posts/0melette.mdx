### A Morning Canvas, Golden and Bright

Oh, Omelette, jewel of the early light,
A culinary canvas, soft and pure and white,
Then golden, folded, when the heat is kind,
The perfect start, for body, soul, and mind.
No breakfast rival holds your lofty claim,
A simple dish, yet whispered is your name.

### The Mighty Egg: Where All Perfection Starts

From humble hen, the source of all your parts,
The egg, a miracle, that steals our hungry hearts.
A complete protein, in its shell contained,
Amino acids, perfectly arraigned.
Nine essential friends, for muscle and for might,
A building block, for morning, noon, and night.
Each yolk, a sun, with vitamins so grand,
A nutritional treasure, held within your hand.

### Protein Power: For Strength and Satiety's Delight

For athletes striving, or for minds alight,
Your protein punch brings lasting, full delight.
No mid-morning slump, no energy's decline,
Just steady fuel, a well-sustained design.
You build the muscle, mend the weary cells,
A power-packed meal, where strength forever dwells.
From workouts hard, to daily tasks so grand,
The Omelette stands, a firm and helping hand.

### Versatility's Crown: A Filling for Every Whim

Then comes the filling, from the pantry's brim,
A symphony of flavours, thin or thick or dim.
Saut√©ed spinach, vibrant, green, and lean,
Or mushrooms earthy, a forest in between.
Sweet bell peppers, crimson, gold, and bright,
Onions softened, a subtle, sweet delight.
A sprinkle of cheese, perhaps, for melting grace,
Each choice a brushstroke, in your perfect space.

* **The Veggie Dream:**
    * Spinach wilting, just a gentle sigh,
    * Tomatoes bursting, reaching for the sky.
    * Mushrooms earthy, whispering secrets old,
    * A garden's bounty, in a golden fold.
* **The Meaty Might:**
    * Ham, diced fine, a savory, salty tease,
    * Turkey breast, bringing comforting ease.
    * A touch of salmon, for a fancy flair,
    * Protein doubled, beyond compare!
* **The Cheesy Charm:**
    * Cheddar melting, gooey, rich, and deep,
    * Feta crumbled, secrets it will keep.
    * Mozzarella stretching, a joyful, milky string,
    * Adding decadence, on joyful wings.

### Quick to Create, a Culinary Bliss

No lengthy hours, for this morning's kiss,
A pan, some eggs, a whisk, you cannot miss.
A sizzle, then a fold, a moment, and you're done,
A perfect meal, beneath the rising sun.
For busy hands, or leisure's gentle pace,
The Omelette fits, with effortless grace.

### Conclusion: A Perfect Start, Without a Doubt

So hail the Omelette, let no doubts remain,
Its protein prowess, washes out all pain.
A culinary champion, versatile and true,
The perfect dish, for me and also you.
From humble eggs, to fillings rich and grand,
The Omelette reigns, across the breakfast land!
